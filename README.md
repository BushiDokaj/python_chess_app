# python_chess_app
A python chess app on a flask website.

Hello!

Welcome to my Python chess application. This is a project I decided to do this summer to develop my programming and web development skills.

The Chess App:

The chess app works by using jquery to send ajax requests to the server when the user clicks on pieces or squares. The server then runs some backend logic built using Python that
does the move. I've defined classes for pieces and created functions that determine how they move and what squares are available to them at any time. I'm also using a board
class to track the state of the board and execute moves. In the future I will try to create an ai that can play against the user, but that is a challenge for another day.

You can check out the site at http://pythonchessapp.herokuapp.com/

Thanks for checking out my project!
